# Udacity C++ Projects

Here I will be documenting my progress and learning collected from the C++ course offered by Udacity. The repository starts at lesson 3, the first two were mostly theoretical.

# Lesson 3 - A* Search
Here I revisited the basics of the A* Search algorithm. Over a sequence of various exercises, I implemented the algorithm to plan the shortest path from a starting point to the goal through obstacles on an ASCII board.

# Lesson 4 - Writing Multifile Programs
Multifile programs are a way of modularizing code to make it easier to handle, understand and modify. Multifile programs utilize C++ feature such as header files, pointers, build tools and classes.
